%when competition is high and ry and rn are close and small they kill
%eachother... if you make r's far apart and smaller competition they do not
%die. This also depends on the starting point, if some starting point for x
%is super dominant it may stay there etc... 
%when k and c are big chaotic behavior gets killed! 
%if r is large, the chaotic jumping happens between values farther apart
%(higher values). If r is small, the chaotic jumping happens between small
%values.
